1. How does inheritance promote the principle of don't repeat yourself (DRY)?  
**Inheritance enables derived classes to use the methods and fields defined in the base class. Once you write the common methods and fields in the base class, you don't repeat yourself for each of the derived classes.**
1. What is the syntax of a derived class that inherits from a base class?  
**The syntax of a derived class that inherits from a base class is class DerivedClass : BaseClass. For example: `class Human : Mammal`**
1. Do all user defined types (classes and structs) inherit from some base class? If so, what is it?  
**All classes inherit from System.Object. User defined structs cannot use user defined inheritance hierarchy, but inherit from the abstract class System.ValueType.**
1. What happens if you do not have a default constructor in a base class when creating a derived class?  
**If you do not have any constructors in a base class, the compiler generates a default constructor for you. If you have defined a non-default constructor in a base class, the derived classes must call a base class constructor or it will result in a compile-time error.**
1. Can you assign a variable of a derived class to another variable of its base class? Why or why not?  
**You can assign a variable of a derived class to another variable of its base class using the same logic that Human == Human and Human == Mammal.**
1. Can you assign a variable of a derived class to another variable of a derived class of its base class? Why or why not?  
**You cannot assign a variable of a derived class to another variable of a derived class of its base class using the same logic that Human == Human but Human != Whale.**
1. Can you assign a variable of a base class to another variable of a derived class? Why or why not?  
**You can assign a variable of a base class to another variable of a derived class but you can access only methods and fields that are defined by the base class. Any additional methods defined by the derived class are not visible through the base class.**
1. Under what circumstances would you want to use the new keyword when defining a method in a derived class?  
**You use the new keyword when defining a method in a derived class when defining a method with the same signature as the base class to signify that you understand that the method in the derived class is hiding the base class method.**
1. What is a virtual method? Why would you want to define a virtual method?  
**A method that is intended to be overridden is called a virtual method. You want to define a virtual method to ensure standardization across derived classes. For example, the Mammal base class might define a virtual method `public virtual void Sleep()`. So while different mammals sleep differently, they method name used is the same for all of them. This prevents you from having to remember if you name the Human sleep method GoToSleep() or anything else; all mammals just Sleep().**
1. What does override do? Why does it do it?  
**Overriding a method is a mechanism for providing different implementations of the same methodâ€”the methods are all related because they are intended to perform the same task, but in a class-specific manner. It does it to allow class specific implementations of a common task. For example, the Human implementation of Sleep() might involve a bed and a pillow, where the Cow implementation of Sleep() might involve standing up.**
1. How do you define an extension type?  
**You define an extension method in a static class and specify the type to which the method applies as the first parameter to the method, along with the this keyword. For example:**
    ```csharp
    static class ExtendInt
    {
      public static int ModInt(this int i)
      {
        return i * 3;
      }
    }
    ```
1. Why do you define an extension type?  
**Using an extension method, you can extend an existing type (a class or a structure) with additional static methods. These static methods become immediately available to your code in any statements that reference data of the type being extended. Also, this is one way to add methods to enumerations.**
