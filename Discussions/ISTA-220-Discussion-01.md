1. What is a console app?
    {0}. **Answer: A console application is an application that runs in a Command Prompt window instead of providing a graphical user interface (GUI)**
2. What does Main() (the main method) do in a console application?
    {0}. **Answer: The Main method designates the program’s entry point. This method should be defined in the manner specified in the Program class as a static method.**
3. What is the purpose of a namespace?
    {0}. **Answer: The purpose of a namespace is to create containers that enable better organization of larger applications.**
4. What is an assembly?
    {0}. **Answer: An assembly is a file that usually has the .dll file name extension, although strictly speaking, executable programs with the .exe file name extension are also assemblies.**
5. What is the starting point in a graphical application?
    {0}. **Answer: In a UWP app, the App.xaml file provides the entry point at which the application starts running.**
6. What does Build do?
    {0}. **Answer: The Build action compiles the C# code, resulting in a program that you can run.**
7. What does Debug do?
    {0}. **Answer: Debug steps through the code and executes it line by line. For console apps, a command window opens and the program runs. If you run the program by using the Start Debugging command on the Debug menu, the application runs, but the command window closes immediately without waiting for you to press a key.**
