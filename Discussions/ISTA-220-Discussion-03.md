1.	What is a method?
    - **A method is a named sequence of statements.**
1. What does a return statement do?
    - **The return statement ends the function call. If you want a method to return information (that is, its return type is not void), you must include a return statement at the end of the processing in the method body. A return statement consists of the keyword return followed by an expression that specifies the returned value and a semicolon.**
1. What is an expression bodied method?
    - **There is actually no difference in functionality between using an ordinary method and an expression-bodied method—an expression-bodied method is merely a syntactic convenience. The main differences are the use of the => operator to reference the expression that forms the body of the method and the absence of a return statement. The value of the expression is used as the return value; if the expression does not return a value, then the method is void.**
1. What is the scope of a variable?
    - **When a variable can be accessed at a particular location in a program, the variable is said to be in scope at that location. To put it another way, the scope of a variable is simply the region of the program in which that variable is usable.**
1. What is an overloaded method?
    - **If two identifiers have the same name and are declared in the same scope, they are said to be overloaded. Often an overloaded identifier is a bug that is trapped as a compile-time error. However, there is a way that you can overload an identifier for a method that is both useful and important. Overloading is primarily useful when you need to perform the same operation on different data types or varying groups of information. You can overload a method when the different implementations have different sets of parameters—that is, when they have the same name but a different number of parameters or when the types of the parameters differ.**
1. How do you call a method that requirements arguments?
    - **To call a method that requires arguments, you provide the arguments in the parenthesis of the method call. You must supply an argument for each parameter, and the value of each argument must be compatible with the type of its corresponding parameter. If the method you’re calling has two or more parameters, you must separate the arguments with commas.**
1. How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, that requires a parameter list?
    - **To write a method that requires parameters, you include the parameters in the parenthesis of the method declaration by providing the name of the type followed by the name of the parameter. If the method you’re writing has two or more parameters, you must separate them with commas. For example, “private void testMethod(int i, double d)” declares a method that takes an integer argument, assigns it to the parameter i, takes a double argument, and assigns it to the parameter d.**
1. How do you specify a parameter as optional when defining a method?
    - **You specify that a parameter is optional when you define a method by providing a default value for the parameter. You indicate a default value by using the assignment operator.**
1. How do you pass an argument to a method as a named parameter?
    - **To pass an argument as a named parameter, you specify the name of the parameter, followed by a colon and the value to use.**
